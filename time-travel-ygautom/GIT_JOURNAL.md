# GIT_JOURNAL

I learned how to use focused branches, atomic commits, and PRs with issue-closing keywords.
Two mistakes I fixed: committing build artifacts and resolving a merge conflict the wrong way.
The command that saved the day: `git rebase --abort` (and `git restore --staged` for quick fixes).
